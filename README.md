## Submission Guidelines

Each problem statement has its own specific submission requirements. Please refer to the `README.md` & `submission_format.md` file in each problem's directory for detailed instructions including:

- File naming conventions
- Required file formats
- Documentation requirements
- Code submission guidelines

## Competition Rules and Guidelines

### General Conduct
- **Maintain Professionalism**: All participants are expected to conduct themselves with civility and respect throughout the competition
- **Academic Integrity**: While collaboration within teams is encouraged, plagiarism from external sources is strictly prohibited
- **Data Usage**: Participants may only use the provided datasets. External data sources are not permitted unless explicitly stated

### Technical Guidelines
- **Large Language Model Usage**: While the use of LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) for assistance is discouraged, it is not strictly forbidden. However, over-reliance on such tools may impact the originality assessment of your solution
- **Code Originality**: Solutions should demonstrate your understanding and implementation skills rather than copied code snippets
